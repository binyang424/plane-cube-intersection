each polyhedra file begins with a header line. you can put anything in here.
the second line is the notional answer for the volume, mostly from mathematica here for compairion purposes
the next line gives the numver of vertices, nvert.
the next block gives the x, y, z coordinates of those nvert vertices.
the next line gives the number of faces.
teh next block gives the face number and how many mface vertices it has
followed by an integer listing of those  mface vertices associated with the face.
